### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ I'm working on a whole bunch of stuff! Currently developing a Mutual Aid web application and my personal website in Node/Express.js
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about technology for social good!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on everything from low-level applications to full-stack web applications. I'm also interested in mobile development and have Windows software dev experience. Have some issues with a project in a language I've worked in? Shoot me a message! :-)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: github@danaimone.com
